# Identity & Sign-In

**What it does:** Manages how customers create accounts, sign in, manage their profile, and control privacy settings.

**Why it matters:** Every loyalty interaction, order history, saved address, and personalised offer depends on a customer being authenticated. Without sign-in, customers can only use guest checkout — they have no access to rewards, order history, or saved preferences.
