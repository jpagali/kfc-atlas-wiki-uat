# Cart

**What it does:** Manages what the customer has selected — items, quantities, rewards, and promos — before they proceed to checkout.

**Why it matters:** Cart integrity is critical to revenue. Pricing errors in the cart, lost cart state, or failed promo applications directly cause abandoned orders.

- **Data Contracts:** Cart (id, lines[], totals, benefits[]) — idempotent ops
- **Source Summary:**
  - All cart operations are idempotent (safe to retry)
  - Pricing correctness: 100% accuracy required (enforced via golden tests in backend)
  - Invalid promo (400): error shown, cart state preserved
  - Cart API: additive changes only, 90-day deprecation window
  - Promo eligibility is always server-side — never computed in Byte Helium
