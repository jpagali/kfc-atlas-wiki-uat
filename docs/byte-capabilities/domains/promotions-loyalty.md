# Promotions & Loyalty

**What it does:** Surfaces personalised offers, manages rewards, tracks challenges, and connects the customer's loyalty account to their orders.

**Why it matters:** Loyalty and promos are key revenue and retention levers. Every mis-rendered offer or failed redemption erodes trust. This domain spans the full customer journey — from discovery to order completion.

:::caution Eligibility is always server-side
Byte Helium never computes promo or reward eligibility locally. All eligibility evaluation happens in the Promo Engine on the server. If an offer appears but fails at redemption, the fix is in the promo configuration in Byte Portal — not in Byte Helium.
