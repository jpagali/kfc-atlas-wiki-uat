# Localisation & Order Mode

**What it does:** Detects the customer's market and language, lets them choose how they want to order (delivery or collection), and selects their store or delivery address.

**Why it matters:** Every subsequent experience — menu, pricing, promotions, checkout — depends on the market context being correctly established first. Getting this wrong means customers see the wrong menu, wrong prices, or can't check out at all.

## Feature Table

| Feature | Problem It Solves | What It Does | How It Works | Dependencies | Prerequisites | Limitations | Impacted Metrics |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Start Localisation** | Customers need to be matched to the right market | Detects customer's market via geo-IP or explicit selection; sets locale | App calls Config service → gets available markets; Geo service resolves location → market confirmed | Geo service, Config service, Context service | Market must be configured in Byte Portal | Context fetch must be ≤150ms p95; market detection can fail if geo blocked | Localisation success rate, drop-off rate |
| **Set Order Mode — Collection** | Customer wants to pick up from a store | Lets customer search for and select a KFC store for collection | Customer selects store → store ID stored in session context | Store Locator, Context service | Store must be active and open | Cannot collect from closed or limited stores | Collection order rate |
| **Set Order Mode — Delivery** | Customer wants food delivered | Lets customer enter a delivery address and validates coverage | Customer enters address → coverage check → delivery zone confirmed | Geo service, Coverage service, Context service | Store with delivery coverage must be available | No fallback if no stores cover address; coverage varies by market | Delivery order rate, coverage hit rate |
| **Find a KFC (Store Locator)** | Customer wants to find their nearest restaurant | Shows a map/list of KFC stores with hours, distance, and features | Calls Store Locator with customer location; returns store list with status and hours | Store Locator, Maps provider, Store data | GPS/location permission or manual address entry | Trading hours managed in Byte Portal; real-time state (open/closed) must be accurate | Store locator engagement |
| **View & Edit Saved Addresses** | Registered customers want to reuse delivery addresses | Shows saved addresses and lets customers edit or delete them | Fetches address list from Address service; updates written back | Address service | Customer must be signed in | Not available to guest users | Address save rate, checkout speed |
