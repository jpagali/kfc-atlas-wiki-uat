# ⚙️ Byte Commerce Backend Capabilities

**Byte Commerce Backend** is the engine behind every transaction on the Atlas platform. It is invisible to customers but orchestrates everything between the front-end and in-store systems — cart management, pricing, tax calculation, payment processing, order state, POS injection, and aggregator order ingestion.

:::note Byte POS Caveat
Byte Commerce talks directly to **Byte POS**. If a market is not using Byte POS, **Byte Connect** must be included in the Byte Commerce onboarding bundle so Byte Commerce can reach the market POS through the path **Byte Commerce -> Byte Connect -> POS**.
:::

Every order placed through Byte Helium is processed by Commerce Backend. Every price the customer sees was calculated by Commerce Backend. Every payment was authorised through Commerce Backend's payment orchestrator.
