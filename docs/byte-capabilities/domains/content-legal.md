# Content & Legal

**What it does:** Renders all non-transactional content — brand pages, FAQs, legal documents, and cookie consent — for each market and locale.

**Why it matters:** Legal compliance and brand trust depend on accurate, up-to-date, localised content. Byte Helium renders what Byte Portal and CMS provide — content quality is a market responsibility.

:::caution Byte Helium renders; markets own the content
Every page in this domain is managed outside Byte Helium. Legal documents are authored by the Legal team in the Legal CMS. Brand pages and FAQs are authored in the CMS (accessible via Byte Portal). Cookie categories are configured in the CMP. If content is wrong or missing, the fix is in the source system — not in Byte Helium.

| **Terms & Conditions** | Legal obligation to display T&Cs | Renders the current T&Cs for the customer's locale | Legal CMS provides versioned documents by locale and effective date | Legal CMS | T&Cs published for market locale | Byte Helium renders only — Legal team manages content | T&C acceptance rate |
| **Privacy Policy** | GDPR and local data law requirement | Renders the current Privacy Policy for the locale | Legal CMS versioned document | Legal CMS | Privacy Policy published | Same as T&Cs — content is Legal's responsibility | Policy view rate |
