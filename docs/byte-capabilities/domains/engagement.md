# Engagement & Messaging

**What it does:** Delivers in-app messages and manages push notification preferences, connecting CRM campaigns to the customer's in-app experience.

**Why it matters:** In-app messaging and push notifications are the primary retention channel between orders. Poor preference management erodes trust and causes opt-outs.
