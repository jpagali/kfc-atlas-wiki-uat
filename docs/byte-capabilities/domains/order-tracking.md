# Order Tracking & History

**What it does:** Lets customers see where their delivery is, view past orders, reorder, and access receipts.

**Why it matters:** Post-order experience shapes NPS and repeat purchase rate. Real-time tracking reduces customer service contacts. Order history drives reorder behaviour.

:::warning Real-time tracking is market-optional
Live GPS delivery tracking is **not automatically available** for every market. It requires integration with a third-party logistics provider. Without this integration, customers see POS order status only (accepted/ready/completed). This must be decided and configured before go-live.
