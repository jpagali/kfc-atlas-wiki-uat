# 🎨 Byte Helium Capabilities

**Byte Helium** is Yum!'s enterprise design system and front-end foundation. In Atlas, KFC's global front-end is built on Helium and skinned for the KFC brand, covering everything from sign-in and menu browsing through to checkout, payment, and post-order tracking.

In the Atlas context, Helium renders what the backend provides. It does not own pricing, promo eligibility, order state, or content — those belong to Byte Commerce, Promo Engine, and CMS respectively. Helium's job is to provide the front-end foundation that Atlas presents through the KFC brand and customer journey.
