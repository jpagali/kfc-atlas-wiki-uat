# Donations & Tips

**What it does:** Allows customers to add a charitable donation (Add Hope) or a tip for their delivery driver during checkout.

**Why it matters:** Add Hope is a globally significant KFC CSR programme. Tips improve driver satisfaction and delivery quality perception. Both require careful payment handling and per-market enablement.
