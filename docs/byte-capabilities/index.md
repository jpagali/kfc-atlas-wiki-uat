# 🧩 Byte Capabilities

> **Audience:** Market Enablement, Launch Teams, Product Managers, Cross-functional Stakeholders
> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for what the Atlas / Byte Helium platform does, how it's structured, and what's needed to go live.

This section lives outside the operational guides by design. The [Front-end Guide](/docs/frontend/overview) and [Admin Portal Guide](/docs/admin-portal-guide/) tell you *how to operate* the platform — Byte Capabilities tells you *what the platform is and what it can do*.

:::note Scope Within Atlas
In Atlas Wiki, **Byte Capabilities** is intentionally scoped to the Atlas **Commerce + Portal** picture. In practice, that means:

- **Atlas** is KFC's global front-end
- **Byte Commerce + Byte Portal** are the commerce and configuration layer behind Atlas
- **Byte Helium** is Yum!'s enterprise design system and front-end foundation that Atlas is built on and branded through
- **Byte Connect** is the middle layer used when a market POS is not Byte POS

The [Admin Portal Guide](/docs/admin-portal-guide/) still owns the step-by-step operating instructions.

## The Platform in One Paragraph

**KFC Atlas** is KFC's global front-end for digital ordering. Atlas itself is built on **Byte Helium**, Yum!'s enterprise design system and front-end foundation, skinned to reflect the KFC brand. Behind that front-end sits the **Byte Commerce + Byte Portal** operating picture: Commerce processes orders, pricing, payments, and POS injection, while Byte Portal manages the market and operational configuration that makes Atlas work in production.

When a market is not on Byte POS, **Byte Connect** becomes the middle layer between Byte Commerce and the market POS environment. Understanding how Atlas, Helium, Commerce, Portal, and Connect fit together is the foundation for launch and operational decision-making.
