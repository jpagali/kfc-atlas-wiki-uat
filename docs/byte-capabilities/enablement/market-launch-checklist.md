# ✅ Market Launch Checklist

> This checklist is built from the [Reality Check](/docs/byte-capabilities/enablement/reality-check) — the dependency gaps and failure patterns that appear in every rollout. Work through it in order. Do not start UAT until Phase 1 is complete.

---

## How to Use This Checklist

Each item has a **risk level** and a **go/no-go gate**. Items marked 🔴 are hard blockers — launch cannot proceed safely without them. Items marked 🟡 should be confirmed before UAT begins. Items marked 🟢 are polish items that should be done before launch day.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Must be complete before any testing)

### 1.1 Byte Portal access & Users

:::danger Go / No-Go Gate
Testing cannot begin until the team has scoped Byte Portal access.
:::

- [ ] Byte Portal environment is provisioned for the market
- [ ] Market admin users invited and assigned correct roles (RBAC)
- [ ] Scope Guard verified — users cannot access out-of-market data
- [ ] MFA enabled for all Byte Portal users

---

### 1.2 Store Configuration

:::danger Go / No-Go Gate
Customers cannot order if stores are missing or misconfigured.
:::

- [ ] All launch stores created in Byte Portal with correct store data

---

---

- [ ] Tax profile assigned to market in Byte Portal

- [ ] Translation keys complete for all UI strings — run coverage report
- [ ] Missing translations confirmed to fall back to English correctly (not to blank fields)

---

:::warning Pre-UAT Gate
Order mode is the entry point — if this fails, no order can be placed.
:::

- [ ] Delivery mode tested end-to-end: address entry → coverage check → menu → checkout → order placed
- [ ] Delivery coverage zones configured in Byte Portal / Geo service (if delivery enabled)
- [ ] Delivery mode disabled for markets not supporting delivery
