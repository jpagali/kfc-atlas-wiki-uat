# Guide: Category Content

Categories are how the KFC menu is organised — grouping products into sections like Chicken, Sides, Drinks, or Desserts. Contentful lets you control the **sequence** of products within a category and manage **subcategories** for more granular menu structure.

:::info
Categories themselves are created and managed in **Byte Admin Portal**. Contentful is where you control sequencing and subcategory structure. Products that haven't been configured in Contentful are **hidden from the menu**.

## Where You See It in the Front-End

**Menu navigation** — Categories appear as top-level navigation items in the menu (e.g. "Burgers", "Sides", "Drinks"). Clicking a category takes the customer to a product grid.

**Subcategories** — Within a category page, subcategories act as tabs or filter groups (e.g. within "Chicken" you might have "Original Recipe", "Zinger", "Wraps"). Products are nested within each subcategory.

**Product sequence** — The order in which products appear within a category or subcategory is controlled in Contentful. If no sequence is set in Contentful, the order falls back to whatever is defined in Byte Admin Portal.

## Use Cases

**New product launch** — When a new item is added in Byte Admin Portal, add and position it in the correct Contentful category so it appears in the right place on the menu immediately.

**Seasonal menu restructure** — Reorder products or promote a subcategory (e.g. move "Holiday Specials" to the top of the menu) for a promotional period without a code deployment.

**Market-specific sequencing** — Different markets may want different orderings for the same category. Each market's Contentful space can be configured independently.

**Subcategory introduction** — Add a new product group (e.g. "Plant-Based" or "Shareboxes") as a subcategory under an existing category without engineering support.
