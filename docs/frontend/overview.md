# Front-end Overview

**KFC Atlas** is KFC's global front-end for digital ordering — what your guests interact with when they order online, through the KFC app, or via a third-party aggregator.

Atlas is built on **Byte Helium**, Yum!'s enterprise design system and front-end foundation. In the broader Atlas platform picture, Atlas works with **Byte Commerce + Byte Portal**, and with **Byte Connect** whenever a market POS is not Byte POS.

This guide is for **restaurant teams and BMUs** who need to understand what the platform delivers to customers, how it behaves in each market, and what is configurable without requiring a product deployment.

## What the Front-end Covers

The Atlas front-end spans four areas:

- **Customer Journey** — the end-to-end flow from discovery to order confirmation
- **Order Channels** — how Dine-in, Delivery, and Takeaway are presented and managed per restaurant
- **Customer Engagement Surveys** — how KFC Listens-style feedback programmes collect post-order sentiment
- **Market Configurations** — what can be switched on or off per market (loyalty, promos, scheduling)

## Design System

The KFC Atlas front-end is built on **Byte Helium**, Yum!'s enterprise design system and front-end foundation. Helium provides the shared design tokens, UI components, and structural patterns; Atlas applies the KFC brand on top of that foundation so the experience feels KFC-native while still using the shared Yum! system underneath.

### Design Philosophy

Atlas is intentionally designed around a **focused buying flow**, not simply the fewest possible clicks. Some journeys may use more steps when that gives customers clearer choices, makes the product easier to understand, and presents relevant trade-up options at the moment they are deciding what to buy.

That means the front-end should be judged by whether the journey is clear, confident, and commercially useful — not only by whether it is short. A meal flow, for example, may expose size upgrades, add-ons, or customization choices step by step because those decisions are easier to understand in context than if every option is collapsed into one dense screen.

See [Design System](/docs/frontend/design-system) for a full explanation of how the visual identity flows from Figma all the way to the screen.
