# Generate One-Time Password

## What this guide covers

Creates a temporary authentication code for a POS terminal or kiosk, used during initial device setup or when re-authenticating an existing device.

:::note Byte POS Caveat
This workflow assumes the device is part of a **Byte POS** setup managed through Admin Portal.

If the market is not using Byte POS, Byte Commerce relies on **Byte Connect** as the bridge to the market POS, so the authentication/setup flow may not match the steps on this page.

## Steps

**Step 1:** Navigate to the **In-Store Devices** section using the left-hand navigation menu.

**Step 2:** Click the **Generate One-Time Password** button.

**Step 5:** Copy the one-time password (OTP) displayed. Provide this code to the person setting up or re-authenticating the POS device. They will enter this code on the device screen to complete authentication.

:::caution
The one-time password is temporary and expires after a set period (typically 15-30 minutes). If the device doesn't accept the code, generate a new one.

:::tip
You can search and filter devices by Station Type, Store Number, and Device Status to find the right location quickly.
