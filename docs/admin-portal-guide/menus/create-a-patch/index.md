**Step 2:** Click on the **Patches** tab to view all patches.

**Step 4:** Enter a descriptive name for the patch. Fields marked with * are required.

| Field | What to enter | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Patch Name** * | A descriptive name for what this patch changes | e.g., “Sydney Q1 Pricing Override”, “Halal Menu Availability Fix”, “Regional Promo Discount”. Used to identify the patch in lists. |

**Step 5:** Select an **Operation** from the dropdown. This defines the type of change the patch will make.

| Operation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Price Override | Change the price of specific items |
| Availability Override | Enable or disable items at certain times |
| Item Enable/Disable | Turn items on or off |
| Other custom operations | Depends on your system setup |

**Step 8:** You can add more operations to the same patch by repeating **Steps 5–7**. Each operation allows bundling related changes together.

**Step 9:** Once you have added all operations, click **Create** to save the patch.

:::tip
You can add multiple operations to a single patch to bundle related changes. For example, you can create one patch that includes both pricing overrides and availability changes for a regional promotion.

Patches are not yet applied to stores. After creating a patch, you must assign it to stores using the “Assign a Patch” guides.
