**Step 3:** Fill in the store details form. Fields marked with * are required.

| Field | What to enter | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Store Name** * | Full display name of the store | e.g., “KFC George Street Sydney” |
| **Store Number** * | Unique numeric identifier assigned by market operations | Must match the Byte POS-assigned store number, or the mapped store identifier used through Byte Connect for non-Byte POS markets |
| **Franchise Code** * | Alphanumeric code identifying the franchisee | Provided by your regional manager |
| **Time Zone** | The store’s local time zone | Required for item snooze and future order accuracy |

:::tip
Before creating a new store, search the Stores list by Name, Number, or Franchise Code to confirm it doesn’t already exist.
:::

:::note Byte POS Caveat
If the market does not use Byte POS, do not assume Byte Commerce will connect directly to the market POS from the store record alone. **Byte Connect** must be onboarded as part of Byte Commerce onboarding.
:::

:::caution
Clicking **Cancel** at any time discards all unsaved information.
