| **Key** | The name of the metadata field | e.g., “campaign_id”, “region”. Defined by your technical team. |
| **Value** | The value for this field | e.g., “CAMP123”, “APAC”. Must match the format your integrations expect. |
| **Public/Private** | Toggle to specify visibility | Public metadata is visible to integrations. Private is for internal tracking. |

**Step 5:** Click the **Save** button to apply the metadata.

:::note
Only add metadata if your technical team has specified the exact keys and values required for your system integrations. Metadata is used to pass additional data to connected systems.
